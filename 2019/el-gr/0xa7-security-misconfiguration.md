API7:2019 Security Misconfiguration
===================================

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **3** | Prevalence **3** : Detectability **3** | Technical **2** : Business Specific |
| Attackers will often attempt to find unpatched flaws, common endpoints, or unprotected files and directories to gain unauthorized access or knowledge of the system. | Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of the API stack, from the network level to the application level. Automated tools are available to detect and exploit misconfigurations such as unnecessary services or legacy options. | Security misconfigurations can not only expose sensitive user data, but also system details that may lead to full server compromise. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

The API might be vulnerable if:

* Appropriate security hardening is missing across any part of the application
  stack, or if it has improperly configured permissions on cloud services.
* The latest security patches are missing, or the systems are out of date.
* Unnecessary features are enabled (e.g., HTTP verbs).
* Transport Layer Security (TLS) is missing.
* Security directives are not sent to clients (e.g., [Security Headers][1]).
* A Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is missing or improperly set.
* Error messages include stack traces, or other sensitive information is
  exposed.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

An attacker finds the `.bash_history` file under the root directory of the
server, which contains commands used by the DevOps team to access the API:

```
$ curl -X GET 'https://api.server/endpoint/' -H 'authorization: Basic Zm9vOmJhcg=='
```

An attacker could also find new endpoints on the API that are used only by the
DevOps team and are not documented.

### Scenario #2

To target a specific service, an attacker uses a popular search engine to search
for  computers directly accessible from the Internet. The attacker found a host
running a popular database management system, listening on the default port. The
host was using the default configuration, which has authentication disabled by
default, and the attacker gained access to millions of records with PII,
personal preferences, and authentication data.

### Scenario #3

Inspecting traffic of a mobile application an attacker finds out that not all
HTTP traffic is performed on a secure protocol (e.g., TLS). The attacker finds
this to be true, specifically for the download of profile images. As user
interaction is binary, despite the fact that API traffic is performed on a
secure protocol, the attacker finds a pattern on API responses size, which he
uses to track user preferences over the rendered content (e.g., profile images).

## How To Prevent

The API life cycle should include:

* A repeatable hardening process leading to fast and easy deployment of a
  properly locked down environment.
* A task to review and update configurations across the entire API stack. The
  review should include: orchestration files, API components, and cloud services
  (e.g., S3 bucket permissions).
* A secure communication channel for all API interactions access to static
  assets (e.g., images).
* An automated process to continuously assess the effectiveness of the
  configuration and settings in all environments.

Furthermore:

* To prevent exception traces and other valuable information from being sent
  back to attackers, if applicable, define and enforce all API response payload
  schemas including error responses.
* Ensure API can only be accessed by the specified HTTP verbs. All other HTTP
  verbs should be disabled (e.g. `HEAD`).
* APIs expecting to be accessed from browser-based clients (e.g., WebApp
  front-end) should implement a proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
  policy.
