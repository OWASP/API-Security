About OWASP
===========

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated
to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications and
APIs that can be trusted.

At OWASP, you'll find free and open:

* Application security tools and standards.
* Complete books on application security testing, secure code development, and
  secure code review.
* Presentations and [videos][1].
* [Cheat sheets][2] on many common topics.
* Standard security controls and libraries.
* [Local chapters worldwide][3].
* Cutting edge research.
* Extensive [conferences worldwide][4].
* [Mailing lists][5].

Learn more at: [https://www.owasp.org][6].

All OWASP tools, documents, videos, presentations, and chapters are free and
open to anyone interested in improving application security.

We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and
technology problem, because the most effective approaches to application
security require improvements in these areas.

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures
allows us to provide unbiased, practical, and cost-effective information about
application security.

OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the
informed use of commercial security technology. OWASP produces many types of
materials in a collaborative, transparent, and open way.

The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project's
long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer,
including the OWASP board, chapter leaders, project leaders, and project
members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.
