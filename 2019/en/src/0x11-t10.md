OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks – 2019
======================================

| Risk | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| A1:2019 - Missing Object Level Access Control | APIs tend to expose endpoints that handle object identifiers, creating a wide attack surface Level Access Control issue. Object level authorization checks should be taken in mind in every function that accesses a data source using an input from the user. |
| A2:2019 - Broken Authentication | Authentication mechanisms are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit implementation flaws to assume other user's identities temporarily or permanently. Compromising system's ability to identify the client/user, compromises API overall security. |
| A3:2019 - Excessive Data Exposure | Looking forward to generic implementations developers tend to expose all object properties without considering their individual sensitivity, relying on clients to perform the data filtering before showing it to the user. Without controlling client's state, servers receive more and more filters which can be abused to gain access to sensitive data. |
| A4:2019 - Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting | Quite often APIs do not impose any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be requested by the client/user. Not only this can impact the API server performance, leading to Denial of Service (DoS), but also leaves the door open to authentication flaws such as brute force. |
| A5:2019 - Missing Function/Resource Level Access Control | Complex access control policies with different hierarchies, groups and roles and a not so clear separation between administrative and regular functions tend to lead to authorization flaws. Exploiting these issues, attackers gain access to other users resources and/or administrative functions. |
| A6:2019 - Mass Assignment | Binding client provided data (e.g. JSON) to data models without proper properties filtering based on a whitelist usually lead to Mass Assignment. Either guessing objects properties, exploring other API endpoints or reading the documentation, providing additional object properties in request payloads, allow attackers to modify object properties they are not supposed to. |
| A7:2019 - Security Misconfiguration | Security misconfiguration is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, unnecessary HTTP methods, permissive Cross-Origin resource sharing (CORS) and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. |
| A8:2019 - Injection | Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization. |
| A9:2019 - Improper Assets Management | APIs tend to expose more endpoints than traditional web applications, what makes proper and updated documentation highly important. Proper hosts and deployed API versions inventory also play an important role to mitigate issues such as deprecated API versions and exposed debug endpoints. |
| A10:2019 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring | Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems and tamper, extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring. |
