API4:2019 Lack of Resource & Rate Limiting
===========================================

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **2** | Prevalence **3** : Detectability **3** | Technical **2** : Business Specific |
| Exploitation requires simple API requests. No authentication is required. Multiple concurrent requests can be performed from a single local computer or by using cloud computing resources. | It’s common to find APIs that do not implement rate limiting or APIs where limits are not properly set. | Exploitation may lead to DoS, making the API unresponsive or even unavailable. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

API requests consume resources such as network, CPU, memory, and storage. The
amount of resources required to satisfy a request greatly depends on the user
input and endpoint business logic. Also, consider the fact that requests from
multiple API clients compete for resources. An API is vulnerable if at least one
of the following limits is missing or set inappropriately (e.g., too low/high):

* Execution timeouts
* Max allocable memory
* Number of file descriptors
* Number of processes
* Request payload size (e.g., uploads)
* Number of requests per client/resource
* Number of records per page to return in a single request response

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

An attacker uploads a large image by issuing a POST request to `/api/v1/images`.
When the upload is complete, the API creates multiple thumbnails with different
sizes. Due to the size of the uploaded image, available memory is exhausted
during the creation of thumbnails and the API becomes unresponsive.

### Scenario #2

We have an application that contains the users' list on a UI with a limit of
`200` users per page. The users' list is retrieved from the server using the
following query: `/api/users?page=1&size=100`. An attacker changes the `size`
parameter to `200 000`, causing performance issues on the database. Meanwhile,
the API becomes unresponsive and is unable to handle further requests from this
or any other clients (aka DoS).

The same scenario might be used to provoke Integer Overflow or Buffer Overflow
errors.

## How To Prevent

* Docker makes it easy to limit [memory][1], [CPU][2], [number of restarts][3],
  [file descriptors, and processes][4].
* Implement a limit on how often a client can call the API within a defined
  timeframe.
* Notify the client when the limit is exceeded by providing the limit number and
  the time at which the limit will be reset.
* Add proper server-side validation for query string and request body
  parameters, specifically the one that controls the number of records to be
  returned in the response.
* Define and enforce maximum size of data on all incoming parameters and
  payloads such as maximum length for strings and maximum number of elements in
  arrays.
