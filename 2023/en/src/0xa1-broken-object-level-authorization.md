API1:2023 Broken Object Level Authorization
===========================================

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **3** | Prevalence **3** : Detectability **2** | Technical **3** : Business Specific |
| Attackers can exploit API endpoints that are vulnerable to broken object level authorization by manipulating the ID of an object that is sent within the request. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. This issue is extremely common in API-based applications because the server component usually does not fully track the client's state, and instead, relies more on parameters like object IDs, that are sent from the client to decide which objects to access. | This has been the most common and impactful attack on APIs. Authorization and access control mechanisms in modern applications are complex and widespread. Even if the application implements a proper infrastructure for authorization checks, developers might forget to use these checks before accessing a sensitive object. Access control detection is not typically amenable to automated static or dynamic testing. | Unauthorized access can result in data disclosure to unauthorized parties, data loss, or data manipulation. Unauthorized access to objects can also lead to full account takeover. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

Object level authorization is an access control mechanism that is usually
implemented at the code level to validate that a user can only access the
objects that they should have permissions to access.

Every API endpoint that receives an ID of an object, and performs any action
on the object, should implement object-level authorization checks. The checks
should validate that the logged-in user has permissions to perform the
requested action on the requested object.

Failures in this mechanism typically lead to unauthorized information
disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data.

Comparing the user ID of the current session (e.g. by extracting it from the
JWT token) with the vulnerable ID parameter isn't a sufficient solution to
solve BOLA. This approach could address only a small subset of cases.

In the case of BOLA, it's by design that the user will have access to the
vulnerable API endpoint/function. The violation happens at the object level,
by manipulating the ID. If an attacker manages to access an API
endpoint/function they should not have access to - this is a case of BFLA
rather than BOLA.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

An e-commerce platform for online stores (shops) provides a listing page with
the revenue charts for their hosted shops. Inspecting the browser requests, an
attacker can identify the API endpoints used as a data source for those charts
and their pattern `/shops/{shopName}/revenue_data.json`. Using another API
endpoint, the attacker can get the list of all hosted shop names. With a
simple script to manipulate the names in the list, replacing `{shopName}` in
the URL, the attacker gains access to the sales data of thousands of e-commerce
stores.

### Scenario #2

An automobile manufacturer has enabled remote control of its vehicles via a
mobile API for communication with the driver's mobile phone. The API enables
the driver to remotely start and stop the engine and lock and unlock the doors.
As part of this flow, the user sends the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to
the API.
The API fails to validate that the VIN represents a vehicle that belongs to the
logged in user, which leads to a BOLA vulnerability. An attacker can access
vehicles that don't belong to them.

### Scenario #3

An online document storage service allows users to view, edit, store and delete
their documents. When a user's document is deleted, a GraphQL mutation with the
document ID is sent to the API.

```
POST /graphql
{
  "operationName":"deleteReports",
  "variables":{
    "reportKeys":["<DOCUMENT_ID>"]
  },
  "query":"mutation deleteReports($siteId: ID!, $reportKeys: [String]!) {
    {
      deleteReports(reportKeys: $reportKeys)
    }
  }"
}
```

Since a document ID is deleted without any further permission checks, a user
may be able to delete another user's document.

## How To Prevent

* Implement a proper authorization mechanism that relies on the user policies
  and hierarchy.
* Use the authorization mechanism to check if the logged-in user has access to
  perform the requested action on the record in every function that uses an
  input from the client to access a record in the database.
* Prefer the use of random and unpredictable values as GUIDs for records' IDs.
* Write tests to evaluate the vulnerability of the authorization mechanism. Do
  not deploy changes that make the tests fail.
