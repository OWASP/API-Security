API6:2023 Server Side Request Forgery
=====================================

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **2** | Prevalence **2** : Detectability **1** | Technical **2** : Business Specific |
| Exploitation requires the attacker to find an API endpoint that receives a URI as a parameter and then accesses the provided URI. URL parsing inconsistencies are well-known for most common programming languages' built-in functions and libraries. | Modern concepts in application development encourage developers to access URIs provided by the client. Usually, server-side data retrieval is not logged, or when it is chances are it isn't being monitored. | Successful exploitation might lead to internal services enumeration (e.g. port scanning) or information disclosure, bypassing firewalls or other security mechanisms. In some cases, it can lead to DoS or the server being used as a proxy to hide malicious activities. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaws occur whenever an API is fetching a
remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker
to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected
destination, even when protected by a firewall or a VPN.

Modern concepts in application development make SSRF more common and more
dangerous.

More common - the following concepts encourage developers to access an external
resource based on user input: Webhooks, file fetching from URLs, custom SSO,
and URL previews.

More dangerous - Modern technologies like cloud providers, Kubernetes, and
Docker expose management and control channels over HTTP on predictable,
well-known paths. Those channels are an easy target for an SSRF attack.


It is also more challenging to limit outbound traffic from your application,
because of the connected nature of modern applications.

The SSRF risk can not always be completely eliminated. While choosing a
protection mechanism, it is important to consider the business risks and needs.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

A social network allows users to upload profile pictures. The user can choose
either to upload the image file from their machine, or provide the URL of the
image. Choosing the second, will trigger the following API call:

```
POST /api/profile/upload_picture

{"picture_url":"http:///example.com/profile_pic.jpg"}
```

An attacker can send a malicious URL and initiate port scanning within the
internal network using the API Endpoint.

```
{"picture_url":"localhost:8080"}
```

Based on the response time, the attacker can figure out whether the port is
open or not.

### Scenario #2

A security product generates events when it detects anomalies in the network.
Some teams prefer to review the events in a broader, more generic monitoring
system, such as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management). For this
purpose, the product provides integration with other systems using webhooks.

As part of a creation of a new webhook, a GraphQL mutation is sent with the URL
of the SIEM API.

```
POST /graphql

[
  {
    "variables": {},
    "query": "mutation {
      createNotificationChannel(input: {
        channelName: \"ch_piney\",
        notificationChannelConfig: {
          customWebhookChannelConfigs: [
            {
              url: \"http://www.siem-system.com/create_new_event\",
              send_test_req: true
            }
          ]
    	  }
  	  }){
    	channelId
  	}
	}"
  }
]

```

During the creation process, the API backend sends a test request to the
provided webhook URL, and presents to the user the response.

An attacker can leverage this flow, and make the API request a sensitive
resource, such as an internal cloud metadata service that exposes credentials:

```
POST /graphql

[
  {
    "variables": {},
    "query": "mutation {
      createNotificationChannel(input: {
        channelName: \"ch_piney\",
        notificationChannelConfig: {
          customWebhookChannelConfigs: [
            {
              url: \"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ec2-default-ssm\",
              send_test_req: true
            }
          ]
        }
      }) {
        channelId
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Since the application shows the response from the test request, the attacker
can view the credentials of the cloud environment.

## How To Prevent

* Isolate the resource fetching mechanism in your network: usually these
  features are aimed to retrieve remote resources and not internal ones.
* Whenever possible, use allow lists of
  * Remote origins users are expected to download resources from (e.g. Google
    Drive, Gravatar, etc.)
  * URL schemes and ports
  * Accepted media types for a given functionality
* Disable HTTP redirections.
* Use a well-tested and maintained URL parser to avoid issues caused by URL
  parsing inconsistencies.
* Validate and sanitize all client-supplied input data.
* Do not send raw responses to clients.
